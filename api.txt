The holidata.net CGI API
------------------------

There really isn't an API, but rather a URL convention.  Data will be obtained
by using an HTTP request, and will have the form:

    https://holidata.net/<locale>/<year>.<format>

This allows the user to select the LOCALE, year and format.

1. The LOCALE must be one of those supported, such as en-US or sv-SE.
2. The year determines which year of data is required, such as 2011.
3. The format may be one of: CSV, XML, YAML, JSON.

Because the data is static content, the web server provides a status code that
indicates success (200) or error (404).
