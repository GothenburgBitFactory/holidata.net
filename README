Holidata.net is a no-nonsense supplier of international holiday data.

- The purpose of holidata.net is to provide a source for free, reliable,
  international holiday data in machine-readable form via a stable API.
- The site will serve only holiday data.
- There will be no ads on the site.
- There will be no impediment to obtaining the data.
- Data access will be through clearly defined URLs.
- The holiday data will be provided in several different formats, such as XML,
  CSV, YAML and perhaps HTML.
- The holidays will be described in their native language, using UTF8.
- There will be a guaranteed availability of data, for example, if a LOCALE is
  supported, that means there is at least data for the current year and next
  year available.
- There will be a web form that allows submission of corrections, additions or
  requests for a new LOCALE.
- Where possible, through the use of Taskwarrior, data will be automatically
  generated.
