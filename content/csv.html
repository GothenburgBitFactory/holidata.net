<h1>CSV Data Format</h1>
<p>
    The CSV (Comma Separated Variable) format is simple and commonly supported.
    One line of text represents a holiday, and within each line, the fields are surrounded by double quotes (") and separated by commas.
    The quotes allow the holiday descriptions to themselves contain commas.
</p>

<p>
    Empty fields are represented by "".
</p>

<p>
    The first line of data contains the field names, in the same format.
</p>

<p>
    All data is provided in UTF-8.
</p>

<h1>Example</h1>
<pre>
    "locale","region","date","description","type","notes"
    "en-US","","2011-01-01","New Year's Day","NF",""
    "en-US","","2011-01-17","Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.","V",""
</pre>

<h1>Fields</h1>
<p>
    <b>locale</b>
    is a combination of an ISO 639-1 language code, such as "en" (English), and an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, such as "US" (United States), separated by a hyphen.
</p>

<p>
    <b>region</b>
    is a subdivision of locale, for those locales that have regional holidays.
    For example, Patriot's Day is only observed in the en-US locale in Massachusetts and Maine, so there are entries for each of those states.
</p>

<p>
    <b>date</b>
    is provided in YYYY-MM-DD format.
</p>

<p>
    <b>description</b>
    is text that simply describes the holiday.
</p>

<p>
    <b>type</b>
    is a collection of single-character indicators, that describe the holiday.
    "N" means national holiday, which means locale-wide.
    "R" means it is a religious holiday.
    "F" means the holiday is fixed, or on the same day each year.
    "V" means variable and is typically tied to a Monday, or the third Thursday, for example.
</p>

<p>
    <b>notes</b>
    are provided in some cases for clarification, but are not to be used as part of the holiday description.
