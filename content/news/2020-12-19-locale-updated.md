The locale Spain (`es-ES`) now contains all holidays from the "Calendario laboral".
<!--more-->
We have cleaned up and updated the locale `es-ES` for Spain.
It now includes all regional holidays from the "Calendrio laboral".
During the cleanup the non-official holidays `Noche Buena` and `Noche Vieja` have been dropped.
We have also switched to the more official names `Epifanía del Señor`, `Todos los Santos`, `Día de la Constitución Española`, and `Natividad del Señor` for the respective holidays.
