The locale Australia (`en-AU`) is now available.
<!--more-->
It took quite some time for the holiday data of Australia to be added, from the [first issue](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/holidata/issues/69) in April 2021 to the [first pull request](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/holidata/pull/84) in February 2022 to now.
While this is a significant milestone, our work is far from over.

As with all our holiday data, maintenance is necessary to keep it up-to-date.
Some states and territories declare holidays annually, and occasionally, holidays are declared due to special occasions.

So we invite you to contribute to Holidata.
Join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ThgvsPUs7m) and help with a country, a region, or even just a holiday.
Your assistance is valuable, and it's not limited to Australia â€“ we currently support 32 countries.
