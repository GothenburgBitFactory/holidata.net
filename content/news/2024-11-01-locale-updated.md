The locale Hungary (`hu-HU`) was updated for 2025.

The holidays according to the _decree on the work schedule around the 2025 public holidays_ (_rendelet a 2025. évi munkaszüneti napok körüli munkarendről_) have been added.

As with all our holiday data, maintenance is necessary to keep it up-to-date.
States like Hungary declare holidays annually and, occasionally, holidays are declared due to special occasions.

Your assistance is valuable, and it's not limited to Hungary – we currently support 32 countries.
