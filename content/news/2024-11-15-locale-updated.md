The locales for the United States (`en-US`, `es-US`) have been updated to include new holiday data.
<!--more-->

#### 'Juneteenth National Independence Day'  
The *Juneteenth National Independence Day* holiday, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans, has been added to our holiday data for the United States.

#### 'In Lieu Of' Holidays
We’ve also included 'in lieu of' holidays, as defined by federal law ([5 U.S.C. 6103](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/)).
These are observed when a federal holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday:
- If the holiday falls on a Saturday, the 'in lieu of' holiday is observed the preceding Friday.
- If the holiday falls on a Sunday, the 'in lieu of' holiday is observed the following Monday.

#### Contribute to Holidata  

As with all our holiday data, maintenance is necessary to keep it up-to-date.
So we invite you to contribute to Holidata.
