### 🇮🇹 Italy Updates

Per [_LEGGE  8 ottobre  2025, n. 151_]( https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2025/10/10/25G00153/sg), Italy established October 4th as the national holiday _Feast of St Francis of Assisi_ from 2026 on.
Additionally, the holidays 'Santi Apostoli Pietro e Paolo' (for the municipality of Rome) and 'Unità nazionale' (celebrated on the first Sunday in November) were added.

### 🇪🇸 Spain Updates

The Spanish holidays of 2026 have been updated according to the official [_Resolución de 17 de octubre de 2025_](https://www.boe.es/eli/es/res/2025/10/17/(2)).

### 🇭🇺 Hungary Updates

The bridge days ("Munkaszüneti nap") for 2026 have been added according to _10/2025. (IV. 30.) NGM rendelet_.

### 🇦🇺 Australia Fix

The date for Labour Day in West Australia was erroneously set to the first Monday in May, not March as laid out in the law.
This has been fixed for 2026 and all previous years.
