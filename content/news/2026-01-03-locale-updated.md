The locale for Poland 🇵🇱 (`pl-PL`) has been updated, adding Christmas Eve to the list of holidays.

<!--more-->
Since February 2025 Christmas Eve is holiday in Poland, based on [Dziennik Ustaw - rok 2024 poz. 1965](https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU20240001965/T/D20241965L.pdf)

This has been [fixed](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/holidata/commit/fbd92927a254e63b0c4c49d5bad312d17fc8de35) and corrected for years 2025 and 2026.
