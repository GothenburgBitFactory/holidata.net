The locale Hungary (hu-HU) is now available.
<!--more-->
With Hungary, we welcome a new member to the holidata family.

As with all other locales, all years from 2011 on are available.
The locale also includes the decreed holidays (_Munkaszüneti nap_) for each year.
The corresponding Saturday which has become a workday can be found in the notes (`"<date> pihenőnap"`) of the respective holiday.
