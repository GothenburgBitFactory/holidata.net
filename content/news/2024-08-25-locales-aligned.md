The locale data has been aligned with the current state of the Holidata Python package.
<!--more-->

We are working towards more automation in the update process of the Holidata files.
In this process, the locale data has been aligned with the state now present in Holidata `2024.8.2`.
This affects locale `hr-HR` data of years `2011` to `2021`.
