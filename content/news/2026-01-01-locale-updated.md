The locale for Australia 🇦🇺 (`en-AU`) has been updated.
<!--more-->
The dates for _Australia Day_ and _Anzac Day_ are usually shifted if they fall on a weekend or Sunday, respectively.
However, the date function of the [holidata library](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/holidata) always returned the original date, not the shifted one.

This has been [fixed](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/holidata/commit/1bebe2960fa1cb04367935498b814c6073eba30c) and corrected for all past years.
