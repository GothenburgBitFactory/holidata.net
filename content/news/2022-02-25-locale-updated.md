The locale Hungary (`hu-HU`) was updated for 2022.
<!--more-->
The holidays according to the _decree on the work schedule around the 2022 public holidays_ (_rendelet a 2022. évi munkaszüneti napok körüli munkarendről_) have been added.

Additionally, we fixed an error in the notes for the swapped holidays.
They now refer correctly to the corresponding Saturday as 'working day' ('_munkanap_').
