<p>
  The XML (Extensible Markup Language) format is very common.
  See <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">http://www.w3.org/XML</a> for a complete description.
</p>

<p>
  Empty fields are represented by empty tags.
</p>

<p>
  All data is provided in UTF-8.
</p>

<h1>Example</h1>
<pre>
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
  &lt;holidays&gt;
  &lt;holiday&gt;
  &lt;locale&gt;en-US&lt;/locale&gt;
  &lt;region&gt;&lt;/region&gt;
  &lt;date&gt;2012-01-01&lt;/date&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;New Year's Day&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;type&gt;NF&lt;/type&gt;
  &lt;notes&gt;&lt;/notes&gt;
  &lt;/holiday&gt;
  &lt;/holidays&gt;
</pre>

<h1>Fields</h1>
<p>
  <b>locale</b>
  is a combination of an ISO 639-1 language code, such as "en" (English), and an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, such as "US" (United States), separated by a hyphen.
</p>

<p>
  <b>region</b>
  is a subdivision of locale, for those locales that have regional holidays.
  For example, Patriot's Day is only observed in the en-US locale in Massachusetts and Maine, so there are entries for each of those states.
</p>

<p>
  <b>date</b>
  is provided in YYYY-MM-DD format.
</p>

<p>
  <b>description</b>
  is text that simply describes the holiday.
</p>

<p>
  <b>type</b>
  is a collection of single-character indicators, that describe the holiday.
  "N" means national holiday, which means locale-wide.
  "R" means it is a religious holiday.
  "F" means the holiday is fixed, or on the same day each year.
  "V" means variable and is typically tied to a Monday, or the third Thursday, for example.
</p>

<p>
  <b>notes</b>
  are provided in some cases for clarification, but are not to be used as part of the holiday description.
