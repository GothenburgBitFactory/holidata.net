<h1>Fields</h1>
<p>
  <b>locale</b>
  is a combination of an ISO 639-1 language code, such as "en" (English), and an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, such as "US" (United States), separated by a hyphen.
</p>

<p>
  <b>region</b>
  is a subdivision of locale, for those locales that have regional holidays.
  For example, Patriot's Day is only observed in the en-US locale in Massachusetts and Maine, so there are entries for each of those states.
</p>

<p>
  <b>date</b>
  is provided in YYYY-MM-DD format.
</p>

<p>
  <b>description</b>
  is text that simply describes the holiday.
</p>

<p>
  <b>type</b>
  is a collection of single-character indicators, that describe the holiday.
  "N" means national holiday, which means locale-wide.
  "R" means it is a religious holiday.
  "F" means the holiday is fixed, or on the same day each year.
  "V" means variable and is typically tied to a Monday, or the third Thursday, for example.
</p>

<p>
  <b>notes</b>
  are provided in some cases for clarification, but are not to be used as part of the holiday description.
